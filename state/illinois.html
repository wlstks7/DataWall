				<p>
Between 2005 and 2012, Illinois received almost 5% of all unauthorized immigration and a little over 4% of legal permanent residents into the United States. Illinois’ unauthorized immigration grew from 2005 to 2007 and declined until 2009. Pre-census data shows a significant drop in immigration, but post-census data showed an increase in 2010. 2011 maintained the same numbers as 2010, and finally decreased in 2012. The odd-looking increase in 2010 is a comparison of the <a href="https://github.com/RGRoland/DataWall/blob/gh-pages/Files/DHS-Source/Unauthorized-Immigrant-Population/Unauthorized-Immigrant-Population-Estimates-in-the-US-January-2010_0.pdf" target="_blank">January 2010 unauthorized immigration report</a> by the Department of Homeland Security and their <a href="https://github.com/RGRoland/DataWall/blob/gh-pages/Files/DHS-Source/Unauthorized-Immigrant-Population/Unauthorized-Immigrant-Population-Estimates-in-the-US-January-2012_0.pdf" target="_blank">amended estimations published in 2012</a> that estimated the unauthorized population using census data. Hovering the mouse on the left side of 2010 displays pre-census estimation and, on the right side, the post-census estimate. Post-census data reveals a 60,000 person underestimation of unauthorized immigrants in 2010, and the reporting methods seem to have adjusted for this in the years after.
				</p>
				<p>
Legal permanent residents increased from 2006 to 2007 and decreased from 2007 to 2009. 2010 maintained the same number of legal immigrants from 2009, an increase in 2011, and another decrease in 2012. Legal permanent residents and unauthorized immigrants peaked the same year in 2007. The lowest unauthorized immigration year for Illinois was 2005 after the census data corrected their 2010 estimate, but there is only a difference of 40,000 unauthorized immigrants from their lowest to highest years of immigration.

					Unauthorized immigration and legal permanent residents from Mexico by the nominal count.

				<h3>
					<a href="../resources.html#method-1">How we found this.</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
Data of unauthorized immigration from Mexico does not follow the general trends. Unauthorized immigration from Mexico increased from 2005 to 2009 despite overall immigration decreasing from 2007 to 2009. Unauthorized immigration from Mexico follows trend during the decline between 2009 and 2012 with only an increase of a few hundred immigrants from 2010 to 2011. Pre and post-census data show an underestimation of 22,577 immigrants from Mexico in 2010, but still follows the general increase in overall immigration. Legal permanent residents from Mexico follow the overall immigration patterns. Legal permanent residents increased from 2006 to 2007 and decreased until 2012 with only one year of a small increase of a few hundred immigrants in 2010.

				<p>
Illinois received almost 5% of all unauthorized immigration and a little over 4% of legal permanent residents into the United States from 2005 to 2012. Comparing the yearly increases and decreases in percentage versus the nominal increases and decreases the “popularity” of immigration into Illinois from Mexico can be quantified compared to the other 49 states.

					<p>
					<strong>Unauthorized Immigration Popularity</strong><br>
From 2005 to 2006, unauthorized immigration popularity decreased as Illinois experienced a lower total of immigration than uniform when there was an overall increase in immigration into the U.S. In 2007, popularity increased due to the rise in nominal and percentage. Popularity decreased again in 2008 even though there was more immigration into the U.S. that year. In 2009, popularity decreased again. Pre-census data showed a decrease in popularity, but post-census data revealed an increase of nominal and percentage for that year. 2011 continued to increase the popularity until 2012 when nominal and percentage decreased.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Legal Permanent Resident Popularity</strong><br>
From 2006 to 2007, Illinois experienced an expected increase from the amount of legal permanent residents into the U.S. that year. Immigration decreased regardless of the immigration into the U.S. from 2008 to 2009 and experienced an expected small increase of a few hundred immigrants in 2010. From 2011 to 2012, nominal and percentage both decreased.					</p>
