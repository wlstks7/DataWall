				<p>
Between 2005 to 2012, Georgia received about 4% of all unauthorized immigration and almost 2% of legal permanent residents into the United States. Georgia's unauthorized immigration grew from 2005 to 2006, maintained in 2007, and decreased in 2008. In 2009 immigration increased again, but fell until 2011 when there was a slight increase. Immigration decreased again in 2012. The odd-looking drop in 2010 is a comparison of the <a href="https://github.com/RGRoland/DataWall/blob/gh-pages/Files/DHS-Source/Unauthorized-Immigrant-Population/Unauthorized-Immigrant-Population-Estimates-in-the-US-January-2010_0.pdf" target="_blank">January 2010 unauthorized immigration report</a> by the Department of Homeland Security and their <a href="https://github.com/RGRoland/DataWall/blob/gh-pages/Files/DHS-Source/Unauthorized-Immigrant-Population/Unauthorized-Immigrant-Population-Estimates-in-the-US-January-2012_0.pdf" target="_blank">amended estimations published in 2012</a> that estimated the unauthorized population using census data. Hovering the mouse on the left side of 2010 displays pre-census estimation and, on the right side, the post-census estimate. Post-census data reveals a 30,000 person overestimation of unauthorized immigrants in 2010, and the reporting methods seem to have adjusted for this in the years after.
				</p>
				<p>
Legal permanent resident immigration into Georgia increased each year from 2006 to 2012 with only 2009 and 2010 maintaining the same number of immigrants. Legal immigration peaked in 2012 at the same time unauthorized immigration was at its lowest. In 2012, there was an estimated 250,000 legal permanent residents and 400,000 unauthorized immigrants.

				<p>
Data of unauthorized immigration from Mexico closely follows the overall immigration trends into Georgia. The only non-conforming year being 2007 when overall immigration maintained the same as the previous year’s numbers, but immigration from Mexico continued to increase. Pre and post-census data show the same decrease in overall and immigration from Mexico. The census data shows an overestimation of 29,677 immigrants from Mexico in 2010. Legal permanent residents from Mexico also follow the overall immigration trends into Georgia with only one year (2007 to 2008) decreasing as overall increased.

				<p>
Georgia received about 4% of all unauthorized immigration and almost 2% of legal permanent residents into the United States from 2005 to 2012. Comparing the yearly increases and decreases in percentage versus the nominal increases and decreases the “popularity” of immigration into Florida from Mexico can be quantified compared to the other 49 states.

				<p>
					<strong>Unauthorized Immigration Popularity</strong><br>
From 2005 to 2007, there was more overall immigration into the U.S., but Georgia’s popularity still declined despite growth from the previous years. In 2008, the percentage and the nominal both decreased, furthering the decline in popularity. After 2008, only 2009 and 2011 showed an increase in popularity through increased percentage and nominal, but all other years were a decline in popularity of immigration into Georgia.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Legal Permanent Resident Popularity</strong><br>
From 2006 to 2007, Georgia’s legal immigration increased though nominal and percentage rises. In 2008, Georgia maintained it’s national percentage and experienced the expected decrease of permanent residents from Mexico and the increase of general immigration. From 2009 to 2010, nominal and percentage increased. Between 2011 and 2012, the percentage remained the same as 2010, and the state experienced expected increases of legal permanent residents from Mexico and other countries.
