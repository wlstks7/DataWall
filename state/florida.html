				<p>
Between 2005 to 2012, Florida received about 7% of all unauthorized immigration and 9% of legal permanent residents into the United States. Florida’s unauthorized immigration grew from 2005 to 2006, maintained from 2006 to 2007, and decreased until 2009. From 2009 to 2011, unauthorized immigration grew and then decreased again in 2012. The odd-looking drop in 2010 is a comparison of the <a href="https://github.com/RGRoland/DataWall/blob/gh-pages/Files/DHS-Source/Unauthorized-Immigrant-Population/Unauthorized-Immigrant-Population-Estimates-in-the-US-January-2010_0.pdf" target="_blank">January 2010 unauthorized immigration report</a> by the Department of Homeland Security and their <a href="https://github.com/RGRoland/DataWall/blob/gh-pages/Files/DHS-Source/Unauthorized-Immigrant-Population/Unauthorized-Immigrant-Population-Estimates-in-the-US-January-2012_0.pdf" target="_blank">amended estimations published in 2012</a> that estimated the unauthorized population using census data. Hovering the mouse on the left side of 2010 displays pre-census estimation and, on the right side, the post-census estimate. Post-census data reveals a 30,000 person overestimation of unauthorized immigrants in 2010, and the reporting methods seem to have adjusted for this in the years after.
				</p>
				<p>
Legal permanent resident immigration into Florida increased each year from 2006 to 2012. The peak year of legal immigration into Florida was 2012. In the same year, unauthorized immigration decreased to the second lowest point in this time. The lowest unauthorized immigration count was in 2009 at 720,000 immigrants.

				</h3>
				<p>
Data of legal and unauthorized immigration from Mexico do not follow the overall trends, though. In 2007, overall unauthorized immigration slightly decreased while immigration from Mexico increased. Pre-census data showed an increase of unauthorized immigrants in general and from Mexico, but post-census data shows that while general immigration increased, immigration from Mexico decreased. The census data shows an overestimation of 37,503 immigrants from Mexico in 2010.

				<p>
Florida received about 7% of all unauthorized immigration and 9% of legal permanent residents into the United States from 2005 to 2012. Comparing the yearly increases and decreases in percentage versus the nominal increases and decreases the “popularity” of immigration into Florida from Mexico can be quantified compared to the other 49 states.

					<p>
					<strong>Unauthorized Immigration Popularity</strong><br>
From 2005 to 2006, the percentage and nominal are both increasing. Regardless of the immigration into the U.S., Florida’s popularity increased. From 2007 to 2009, the popularity of immigration decreased despite the nominal growth in 2007. In 2010, pre-census data showed a nominal and percentage increase, but post-census data shows a decrease in popularity of nominal and percentage. In 2011, percentage and nominal were both increasing, and regardless of the U.S. total immigration, Florida’s popularity increased. 2012 has the same percentage as 2011, so, in relation to overall immigration into the U.S., Florida experienced the expected nominal totals for that year.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Legal Permanent Resident Popularity</strong><br>
Legal immigration into Florida increased from 2005 to 2012 by percentage. From 2006 to 2008, Florida’s percentage and nominal are both increasing, and regardless of the U.S. total immigration, popularity increased. In 2009 there was less overall immigration into the U.S., but the state still experienced higher totals. From 2010 to 2011, Florida continued to increase its popularity by increasing percentage and nominal numbers. 2012 has the same percentage as 2011, so, in relation to overall immigration into the U.S., Florida experienced the expected nominal totals for that year.
