State Immigration Popularity Scenarios

1. If percentage and nominal are both increasing, the state's popularity, regardless of the U.S. total immigration, increased.

2. If percentage and nominal are both decreasing, the state's popularity, regardless of the U.S. total immigration, decreased.

3. If the percentage is the same as the previous year, the state experienced expected nominal totals of immigration in relation to the overall increase/decrease of immigration into the U.S.

4. If percentage decreases and nominal increases, there was more overall immigration into the U.S., but the state experienced a lower total than uniform (Decrease in popularity).

5. If percentage increases and nominal decreases, there was less overall immigration into the U.S., but the state experienced a higher total than uniform (Increase in popularity).
